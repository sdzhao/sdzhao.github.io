	  I have taught several topics to students with varied backgrounds:
	  <ul>
	    <li>STAT 212: A first course in biostatistics</li>
	    <li>STAT 434: Survival analysis</li>
	    <li>STAT 441: The practice of applied statistics</li>
	    <li>STAT 530: Graduate bioinformatics</li>
	    <li>STAT 578: Topics courses for statistics PhD students</li>
	  </ul>
	   I have been selected to the University of Illinois's <a href="https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/measurement-evaluation/teaching-evaluation/teaching-evaluations-(ices)/teachers-ranked-as-excellent">List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students</a> for multiple courses over multiple semesters.

	  <p>
	    My main approach is to help students understand how the statistical topics they learn are connected to each other and to other disciplines at a fundamental level.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I developed new material to explain the connection between statistics and data analysis. I contextualize statistical concepts and methods in the larger scientific process of answering substantive questions using quantitative data. I created a new curriculum to teach these concepts in my STAT 441 and STAT 530 courses, which attract students from multiple departments across the univeristy.

	  <p>
	    I also emphasize the connection between different statistical methods. I illustrate how most analysis procedures are all based on the same core set of statistical and probabilistic principles. I aim to teach students to start from these core principles to <a href="https://digital.archives.caltech.edu/islandora/object/image%3A2545">create and understand</a> analysis procedures instead of simply memorizing them. I developed new material to teach my STAT 212, STAT 434, and STAT 578 courses in this way.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Finally, I teach PhD students to do research. I have so far have been fortunate to advise:

	  I have taught several topics to students with varied backgrounds:
	  <ul>
	    <li>STAT 212: A first course in biostatistics</li>
	    <li>STAT 430: The practice of applied statistics</li>
	    <li>STAT 434: Survival analysis</li>
	    <li>STAT 530: Graduate bioinformatics</li>
	    <li>STAT 578: Topics courses for statistics PhDs</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>
	    My main goal is to help students understand how the statistical topics they learn are connected to each other and to other disciplines. I have been selected to the University of Illinois's <a href="https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/measurement-evaluation/teaching-evaluation/teaching-evaluations-(ices)/teachers-ranked-as-excellent">List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students</a> for multiple courses over multiple semesters.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    One common disconnect is between statistics and data analysis. I am interested in embedding statistical concepts and methods in the larger scientific context of how substantive questions can be answered using quantitative data. I created a new curriculum to teach these concepts in my STAT 430 course, which attracts everyone from undergraduate students in statistics to PhD students from departments across the univeristy.

	  <p>
	    Another common disconnect is between different statistical methods. I am interested in illustrating how standard procedures are all based on the same core set of statistical and probabilistic principles. I am interested in how to teach students to start from these core principles to <a href="https://digital.archives.caltech.edu/islandora/object/image%3A2545">create and understand</a> standard procedures. I teach my STAT 212 and STAT 434 courses in this way.

	    Finally, I am interested in how to teach PhD students to do research. I have so far have been fortunate to advise:

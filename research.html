	  I started out in the natural sciences. My undergraduate degree is in chemistry and physics, with a focus on synthetic organic chemistry. But I was interested in a lot of other subjects, and I realized that studying statistics in graduate school could let me explore all of them.

	  <p>
	    So now I am a statistician, and my research centers around on large-scale statistical inference with highly multiplexed genomic data, particularly as applied to molecular neuroscience.

	    One main difficulty is that biological questions are explanatory in nature, asking how and why things are the way they are, but statistics is for the most part descriptive. I am interested in developing analysis strategies for genomic data that bridge the gap between description and explanation. I'm currently focused on <a href="publications.html">spatial transcriptomics and behavioral genomics</a>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    A hallmark of genomics research is that it asks a huge number of biological questions simultaneously, made possible by high-throughput technology. But more questions also leads to more inductive uncertainty. I am interested in understanding the fundamental statistical principles that make it possible to reduce this uncertainty. I'm currently studying <a href="publications.html">empirical Bayesian inference</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Finally, I am interested in developing new statistical inference procedures. My <a href="publications.html">other work</a> includes high-dimensional inference, multiple hypothesis testing, precision matrix estimation, and survival analysis methods.

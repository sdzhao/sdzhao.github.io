	  <p>
	    My statistical research centers around large-scale statistical inference with highly multiplexed genomic data, particularly as applied to neurogenomics.
	  </p>

	  
	  <p>
	    Before elaborating, it might be useful to first fix a working definition of "statistics", given how rapidly the field is changing.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    My perspective is that statistics is the study of how quantitative data can give substantive understanding (about some phenomenon of interest). The central challenge is that data by itself cannot directly "enter the mind" [<a href="#fisher">1</a>]. To address this, statisticians engage in three types of activities:
	    <ol>
	      <li>introducing population-level quantitative constructs that are substantively meaningful [<a href="#nelder">2</a>],</li>
	      <li>developing concepts and methods to infer those quantities from observed data, and</li>
	      <li>understanding when and why those methods work.</li>
	    </ol>
	    
	  <p>
	    My research spans these activities in the context of genomics.
	    <ol>
	      <li>I define new quantitative constructs useful for understanding different types of genomic data. I'm currently focused on spatial transcriptomics and behavioral genomics. For example, we recently studied <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49457-w">transcript colocalization for single molecule-resolution spatial transcriptomics data</a>.</li>
	      <li>I develop new statistical methods to estimate and perform inference on these quantities. I mainly draw from <a href="publications.html">large-scale inference procedures</a> coming from high-dimensional statistics, multiple hypothesis testing, mediation analysis, and survival analysis methods.</li>
	      <li>A hallmark of high-throughput genomics experiments is that they simultaneously profile a huge number of biological features, such as mutations or genes. I am interested in understanding the fundamental statistical principles underlying simultaneous inference. For example, we recently developed a new <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2205.00336">regression-based reformulation of empirical Bayes estimation</a>.</li>

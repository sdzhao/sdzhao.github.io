	  I started out in the natural sciences. My main focus in college was on organic chemistry, but I was interested in everything. I eventually realized that studying statistics would let me, as Tukey said, play in everyoneâ€™s backyard. So now I am a statistician, and I'm interested in both the process of applying statistics to science, particularly to biology and genomics, and the theoretical nature of large-scale statistical inference.
	  
	  <p>
	    One main difficulty is that biological questions are explanatory in nature, asking how and why things are the way they are, but statistics is for the most part descriptive. I am interested in developing analysis strategies for genomic data that bridge the gap between description and explanation. I'm currently focused on <a href="publications.html">spatial transcriptomics and behavioral genomics</a>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    A hallmark of genomics research is that it asks a huge number of biological questions simultaneously, made possible by high-throughput technology. But more questions also leads to more inductive uncertainty. I am interested in understanding the fundamental statistical principles that make it possible to reduce this uncertainty. I'm currently studying <a href="publications.html">empirical Bayesian inference</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Finally, I am interested in developing new statistical inference procedures. My <a href="publications.html">other work</a> multiple hypothesis testing, precision matrix estimation, and high-dimensional survival analysis methods.
